# Alarm Clock in Python

## 📌 Introduction
This is a simple Alarm Clock application built using Python. The program allows users to set an alarm for a specific time, and it will trigger a notification or play a sound when the time is reached.

## 🛠 Features
- Set an alarm for a specific time
- Plays a sound or beeps when the alarm goes off
- Uses `datetime` and `time` modules for accurate timing
- User-friendly console interface

## 📂 Project Structure
```
📁 Alarm-Clock
│-- alarm_clock.py  # Main Python script
│-- alarm_sound.mp3  # Alarm sound file (optional)
│-- README.md  # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

- Python 3.x
- `playsound` module (for playing sound)

Install missing dependencies using:
```sh
pip install playsound
```

## 🖥 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alarm-clock.git
   cd alarm-clock
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python alarm_clock.py
   ```
3. Enter the alarm time in **HH:MM:SS** format and wait for the alarm to trigger.

## 📝 Usage Example
```
Enter the time for the alarm (HH:MM:SS): 07:30:00
Alarm set for 07:30:00
⏰ Time's up! Wake up!
```

## 🎵 Customizing the Alarm Sound
You can replace `alarm_sound.mp3` with your own audio file. Update the Python script accordingly:
```python
playsound('your_custom_sound.mp3')
```

## 🛠 Future Improvements
- GUI-based alarm clock
- Snooze functionality
- Multiple alarm settings
